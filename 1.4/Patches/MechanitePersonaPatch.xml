A simple patching operation for the mods, Mechanite Plague & More Persona Traits.
At the moment, I hope it does the following:
- Adds Mechanite Plague Immunity to existing WeaponTraitDef and relevant description/tooltip changes to show new immunity into the game.

Added Insertions:
MPT_Hediff_ImmuneMechanite: Added a ModExtension to allow MPT_Hediff_ImmuneMechanite the ability to prevent new instances of the Mechanite Plague from infecting the wielder.
A ModExtension is used because of how the Mechanite Plague is applied to pawns. A makeImmuneTo entry is added simply for the tooltips so players know that their pawns are safe.

Replacement Edits:
MPT_Bonded_ImmuneMechanite: The relevant parts of the description have been simplified down to "prevent mechanite intrusion". Feel free to change this if you want or anything for that matter.
MPT_Hediff_ImmuneMechanite: Same deal as above. This is done just to cover the all bases concerning "mechanite intrusion".

Note: Clean up! Now everything is in it's proper place instead of everything using PatchOperations. Got cluttered pretty fast.

Try NOT getting forcibly implanted with bursters.</description>
