A ThoughtDef.
At the moment, I hope it does the following:
- Add a bonded thought that will reduce mood gradually as Plaguelust decreases but increase if Plaguelust is satisfied.

New Additions:
MPT_Thought_Plaguelust: This thought plus its accompanying mood debuff will show that the persona weapon really IS driving you insane.
