At the moment, I hope it does the following:
- Add Keyed Tags in my C++ code to call wherever I need them.

Breakdown Version - Individual Parts here:

MPT_MechaniteOnHitDesc -> Upon landing a hit, the persona weapon has a {0} chance to {1} {2}{3}~{4}.\n{5}
{0} -> ProcChance -> X%
{1} -> MPT_ApplyMechaniteDesc -> apply/increase the severity of the {0} to -> {0} -> MPT_HediffDef -> Mechanite plague
{2} -> TargetSelf/!TargetSelf -> the wielder/the target
{3}~{4} -> MPT_MinSeverityDesc + MPT_MaxSeverityDesc -> by X~X%
\n\n -> 2x Line break in code
{5} -> MPT_ExtraSpawnDesc -> Spawns {0} additional Burster(s) upon target's death. -> {0} -> extraSpawns

Please see MechaniteWeaponTraitDefs to see variable information.
Complete Version - What this will look like in-game (hopefully):

Upon landing a hit, the persona weapon has a X% chance to apply/increase the severity of the Mechanite plague to the target by X~X%.

Spawns X additional Burster(s) upon target's death.

Hopefully that makes thing's clear if you attempt to localize my work.
