I created this mod because I love the Mechanite Plague and have taken great interest in what makes it tick and I saw potential in it for other mods. However, I scowered the workshop looking for add-ons created by Irecreeper or others who also took interest in the mod and found none... so I went about making my own homemade XML patches just for my own Rimworld save but I found myself repeatedly making more and more patches. After a bit of clean up I found that I had made something that other people might enjoy so... why not release it to everyone?

Remember to leave feedback or tips for me! I would love to improve this mod further and that won't happen without a little bit of help!
This is the GitHub respository for the Mechanite Persona Traits mod and I hope you enjoy.
